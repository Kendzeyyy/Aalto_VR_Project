# Aalto Virtual Reality Project
  
Aalto Virtual Reality Project was made by 3 students from Metropolia UAS. The goal for this project is to create a personal timeline
where you can see your own past through social media. In the world you interact with the cubes that represent months. You can then drop 
the months on certain year and you will get 3 smaller cubes that is your used social medias. In the prototype version there was Flickr, 
Spotify and YouTube. You can then pick up the social media cube and throw it on the big screen to show the picture or video or sound. 
The project was strongly focused on usability so it's easy for everyone! Also the sound surrounding had a big role in this project.
